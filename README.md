# Hitman Unlocker
Hitman Unlocker is a simple module that makes draw distance in Hitman Codename 47 fully configurable.

To install HitmanUnlocker, simply download **DSOUND.dll** from the [latest release](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/HitmanUnlocker/releases/latest) and place it in your root Hitman Codename 47 directory.
After launching the game, navigate to **Options** -> **Mouse & Keyboard**, and set the **IncreaseDrawDistance** and **DecreaseDrawDistance** to keys of your choice.

You can then go in-game and configure the draw distance by using the previously selected keys.

It should be noted that this game starts to perform really badly at higher draw distances, and even though a very beefy computer **might** be able to handle it at a decent framerate with draw distance all the way up, most computers won't on certain levels.

If you wish to disable Hitman Unlocker completely, simply remove **DSOUND.dll** from your game directory.
